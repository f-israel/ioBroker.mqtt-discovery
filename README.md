## mqtt-discovery adapter for ioBroker

Adapter, der MQTT Discovery Nachrichten für Home Assistant generiert

> [!WARNING]
> This is my very first ioBroker adapter!  
> This project is in active development—imagine a mad scientist’s lab where experiments are a daily routine. Expect quirky behavior, unexpected bugs, and plenty of caffeine-fueled code as I learn the ropes. Every bug report and suggestion earns a virtual high-five!
> Happy hacking and enjoy the chaos!
